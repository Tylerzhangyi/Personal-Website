      "content": "# The Power Beyond Code\\n\\n## ——The Story of a Public Welfare Enthusiast Programmer's Transformation into a Teacher\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;When people think of Teacher Mu Jiang, their first impression is often of a teacher with exceptional computer skills and a unique teaching style. In fact, Teacher Mu Jiang was once Alibaba's youngest technical expert and a public welfare advocate dedicated to benefiting society through innovation. Today, let us step into his world and see how a programmer passionate about public welfare transformed into a teacher.\\n\\n## How a Programmer is Forged\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Teacher Mu Jiang's connection with computers began in elementary school.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;He started playing CS (Counter-Strike) in elementary school, and in middle school, his father bought him a computer but didn't connect it to the internet. So he could only use offline software, like design software and animation software. He began exploring these tools.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;This experience greatly influenced Mu Jiang's eventual choice to become a programmer and laid the foundation for his future path in computing.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;In high school, Mu Jiang formally began learning computer programming. Learning computer science was not easy, but as Teacher Mu Jiang put it, studying computers is \\\"tiring and difficult, but also very enjoyable.\\\"\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Facing difficulties, he did not retreat but instead found joy in them. When he first started learning C++, he felt confused and lost, but he did not give up. Instead, he would set aside time every week to visit Xinhua Bookstore to search for computer-related books. He read extensively and tried to understand new knowledge. Despite the challenges, the joy of turning \\\"the unknown into the known\\\" each time brought him immense satisfaction.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;However, becoming a programmer was not a direction Mu Jiang had determined from the start.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;After graduating from university, he chose to embark on an entrepreneurial journey. During this process, writing proposals and giving presentations could bring money, but they left him exhausted. In contrast, during his entrepreneurial journey, he discovered that he had both talent and passion for programming. When he was programming, he could fully immerse himself without feeling tired, which gradually confirmed his career direction.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Over time, Teacher Mu Jiang gradually grew into an excellent programmer and completed some important achievements. At a game company, Mu Jiang completed his most satisfying work—a data analysis tool that helped the company better place advertisements. This achievement not only helped the company save hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs daily but also deeply inspired him.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Later, he came to Alibaba and became Alibaba's youngest technical expert. The \\\"Data V\\\" he developed at Alibaba Cloud had a profound impact on China's big data industry, providing enterprises with low-cost data visualization solutions. \\\"After our product was released, China's data visualization industry rapidly developed, basically reaching the level where everyone has one.\\\"\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;With an innovative spirit, maintaining curiosity about life, and persisting in one's ideals—this is how a programmer is forged.\\n\\n## Reaching for the Sky\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;\\\"I initially saw others doing public welfare, and then I gradually started doing public welfare too. The directions of public welfare involve many things, and many are coincidences. But if we're talking about public welfare in general, I actually started very early.\\\" This is what Mu Jiang said when discussing public welfare.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Starting in 2011, Mu Jiang devoted himself to public welfare, determined to use his professional knowledge and skills to change people's lives. He believes that public welfare is not necessarily limited to helping disadvantaged groups; it can also benefit more people through technology and knowledge sharing.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Initially, Mu Jiang joined W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative and began translating various English materials for people in China. This began his public welfare journey. During this process, he gradually realized that knowledge and technology could become key forces in changing people's lives. Thus, he began actively participating in various public welfare projects, solving difficulties for disadvantaged groups and rural education.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;As Alibaba's Rural Technology Revitalization Officer, Mu Jiang, in collaboration with another revitalization officer, Teacher Cao Lin, discovered a major problem in China's rural education: while the quality of elementary education is high, science and technology education lags far behind cities. Therefore, they decided to launch the public welfare project \\\"Reaching for the Sky\\\" to lead rural children to explore the mysteries of the stars and the universe through science popularization. These public welfare activities achieved an impact even stronger than writing code.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;Through organizing courses, rocket launches, and astronomical telescope observations, they allowed children to experience the charm of technology up close, sparked their interest in science, and brought unprecedented wonderful experiences to rural students.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;When discussing the gains from public welfare projects, Mu Jiang stated that the greatest value of public welfare lies in giving everyone the opportunity to truly help others. This is not only significant for individuals but also beneficial to society. He believes that whether doing public welfare or engaging in business, as long as it makes one feel \\\"the fragrance always remains in the hand that gives the rose,\\\" it is very worthwhile. He will continue to engage in public welfare activities in the future and encourages everyone to try doing some public welfare work within their capabilities. This also aligns with Yungu's goal of cultivating \\\"innovators who benefit the world.\\\"\\n\\n## Playing with Real Things\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;From the beginning, Mu Jiang was full of longing for the education industry. He believes that \\\"education is a special cause because it can benefit people for a lifetime and is always needed by society.\\\" For him, education is not just a career choice but also a mission and responsibility. While comprehensive development is indeed worth advocating, such concepts often marginalize students with special talents who are not good at standardized testing. Mu Jiang believes this is not the only standard for measuring a person's ability. He thinks that many people cannot achieve success in their areas of expertise because of the limitations of the education system. \\\"I really hope to make some contribution, to change things a little bit, so I came to Yungu.\\\" This is what Mu Jiang said.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;At Yungu School, Mu Jiang teaches computer science-related courses, such as ICT and Computer Science Principles. His teaching style is unique, advocating \\\"playing with real things.\\\"\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;In his interactions with students, Mu Jiang always emphasizes flexibility and practicality. He encourages students to practice hands-on and solve problems themselves, rather than passively receiving knowledge. He is committed to providing students with real experiences and cases, not just theoretical knowledge, which is far more important than merely memorizing code.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;When teaching computer network principles, he not only tells students about the seven-layer structure of networks and the functions of each layer but also helps them understand the logic behind each layer and the problems it solves. Through hands-on practice and case analysis, students can understand knowledge more deeply and apply it flexibly. Mu Jiang believes that only by truly understanding the essence and application of knowledge can students make better choices and innovations in their future development.\\n\\n&emsp;&emsp;A Yungu computer teacher who likes to play with real things, a caring public welfare advocate who innovatively spreads knowledge. This is Mu Jiang. He not only imparts technology but also ignites the flame in students' hearts, allowing them to dare to pursue their dreams and courageously create the future, creating power beyond code. May we all be like Teacher Mu Jiang, using our own strength to light up others' lives, becoming \\\"innovators who benefit the world,\\\" and making the world a better place because of our existence.",

      "title": "SHM Project PCB Iteration Report",
      "excerpt": "A detailed report on the iterative design process of the F-18 cockpit control PCB, addressing circuit design challenges and DCS BIOS integration issues.",
      "content": "**Authors:** Tyler, Eric\\n**Programming CCA**\\n**21 December 2024**\\n\\n# SHM Project PCB Iteration Report\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nIn last year's F-18 project, we used a breadboard-based setup with external wiring. During the final validation phase, we failed to establish successful interaction with DCS BIOS. Considering the need for greater convenience and easier troubleshooting, we came up with the idea of designing a custom PCB (printed circuit board) integrated circuit.\\n\\n## Initial Ver. PCB\\n\\n![SHM1](/photos/SHM1.png)\\n\\n### Content Overview:\\n\\n1. Instead of connecting each pin of the buttons with individual wires, we integrated the buttons directly onto the PCB, so that wires only need to be connected to the designated signal transmission and detection pins.\\n\\n2. We implemented GND copper pour across the board, reducing wiring clutter and improving electrical stability.\\n\\n3. A 1x5 pin header is arranged on each of the four sides, ensuring consistent and organized wiring on every edge, minimizing fragmentation and making modifications more convenient.\\n\\n### Test Results:\\n\\nThe PCB did not meet our expectations and, similarly, failed to interact with DCS. Iteration and further refinement are required.\\n\\n## First Iteration\\n\\n### Problem Identification:\\n\\nDuring the first iteration, we revisited the circuit board designed last semester and found that it failed to meet the expected requirements during the final validation phase. Through detailed analysis, we identified three main design flaws:\\n\\n1. **Disorganized Component Layout:** All connection ports were placed on the front side of the circuit board, which prevented the proper installation of the enclosure, compromised the overall system stability, and made operation inconvenient.\\n\\n2. **Chaotic Wiring Arrangement:** The routing of traces and placement of connectors were negatively affecting both the circuit board's performance and the assembly process.\\n\\n3. **Failure to Communicate with DCS BIOS:** We initially hypothesized that excessive resistance in the circuit caused the signal strength to drop below the threshold required for the game to detect, preventing successful interaction.\\n\\n### Improvement Plan:\\n\\nTo address these issues, we implemented the following design modifications:\\n\\n1. **Component Relocation:** All components were moved to the back side of the PCB, ensuring that the front side remains free of obstructions. This allows the enclosure to be properly installed and improves both system stability and usability.\\n\\n2. **Power Plane Copper Pour:** We replaced traditional wiring with copper pour for power distribution, simplifying the design and enhancing electrical stability. This approach is particularly effective for 5V and GND routing, improving efficiency during assembly and usage. It also eliminates the common issue of wires detaching from pin headers.\\n\\n3. **Redesign of Button Module Layout:** We optimized the structure of the button units by removing the individual resistors connected to the negative terminals of the LEDs. Instead, we connected all buttons and ground lines in series. By leveraging the internal resistance of the buttons in combination with a single pull-down resistor, we significantly reduced component count, improved functionality and reliability, and made PCB assembly much more efficient and convenient.\\n\\n![SHM2](/photos/SHM2.png)\\n\\n### Test Results:\\n\\nAfter testing, PCB 1.0 still failed to communicate with DCS BIOS, indicating that issues persist and further iteration is required.\\n\\n## Second Iteration\\n\\n### Problem Identification:\\n\\nDuring the second iteration, we further refined the circuit board design. Although the first iteration resolved some issues, during the assembly and testing phase, we identified significant flaws in PCB 2.0. After troubleshooting with a multimeter performed by a classmate, we pinpointed the root cause of PCB 1.0's failure: the buttons were malfunctioning. In addition to this critical issue, we also addressed several design flaws in the 1.0 version that had previously gone unnoticed:\\n\\n1. **5V and GND Not Properly Connected to the Chip:** There was no direct connection between the power pads (5V and GND) on the PCB and the microcontroller chip, resulting in the circuit failing to power correctly and operate as intended.\\n\\n2. **Buttons Not Functioning:** The button signal lines were incorrectly tied directly to 5V, causing them to remain in a permanently \\\"on\\\" state. As a result, pressing the buttons did not produce a detectable change in signal, making it impossible for the system to register user input.\\n\\n### Improvement Plan:\\n\\nTo address these issues, we implemented the following improvements:\\n\\n1. **Added Power Connection Interfaces:** We added four additional connection points between the 5V/GND pads and the microcontroller chip on the PCB. This ensures a stable power supply and improves reliability— even if one connection fails, the remaining three can still maintain proper functionality.\\n\\n2. **Major Redesign of Button Module Structure:** We completely restructured the button module's layout and wiring configuration to ensure accurate signal response. The revised design eliminates the previous short-circuit issue and allows each button to generate a clear on/off signal when pressed, enabling reliable detection by the system. (As shown in the figure below)\\n\\n![SHM3](/photos/SHM3.png)\\n\\n3. **Redesign of Wiring and Interface Layout:** We again planned the routing and placement of interfaces on the PCB. The original 1x5 pin headers were replaced with 2x5 headers to improve connection stability and reduce space usage. Additionally, we changed the layout of the pin headers from being concentrated on the top edge of the PCB to a corner-distributed arrangement—placing one at each of the four corners. This minimizes cable congestion at the top, improves spatial organization, and enhances overall assembly efficiency. (As shown in the figure below)\\n\\n![SHM4](/photos/SHM4.png)\\n\\n### Test Results:\\n\\nWe observed signal output on the Arduino; however, the PCB still failed to establish communication with DCS BIOS. Further improvements and debugging are required.\\n\\n## Third Iteration\\n\\n### Problem Identification:\\n\\nIn previous testing, we observed signal output on the Arduino, yet the system still failed to communicate with DCS BIOS. Based on this behavior, we have two hypotheses:\\n\\n1. **Incorrect Button Configuration:** DCS BIOS requires buttons to be set up in a pull-up configuration, but our current circuit uses a pull-down design, which may prevent proper signal interpretation by the software.\\n\\n2. **Potential Firmware Error:** The code uploaded to the microcontroller may be incorrect or improperly configured, causing DCS BIOS to fail in recognizing the incoming signals.\\n\\n### Improvement Plan:\\n\\n1. Use a breadboard to build a simple button circuit and test it with the preset code provided in the Arduino library, simulating the expected signal behavior for DCS BIOS.\\n\\n2. If the test shows that DCS successfully recognizes the button inputs, the issue likely lies in the firmware. In this case, we will consult official documentation and online resources to revise the microcontroller code accordingly.\\n\\n3. If DCS still fails to detect the signals, we will redesign the button circuit on the PCB using a pull-up configuration as required by DCS BIOS. Additionally, we will add a single large resistor in series with the entire button group to limit current flow, reducing the risk of damaging the buttons or the microcontroller and improving overall circuit reliability.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThrough two rounds of iteration, we addressed several critical issues in the PCB design, significantly improving its functionality, reliability, and ease of assembly. The first iteration focused on optimizing component placement and implementing power plane copper pour to enhance stability and reduce wiring complexity. The second iteration resolved key structural flaws, including the lack of proper 5V/GND connections to the microcontroller and the malfunctioning button circuitry.\\n\\nDespite these improvements, the current version of the PCB still fails to communicate with DCS BIOS, indicating that further refinement is necessary. While we have made substantial progress in both design and troubleshooting, achieving full compatibility requires continued investigation—particularly into the button configuration (pull-up vs. pull-down) and firmware correctness. This project has reinforced the importance of iterative development, systematic testing, and attention to both hardware and software integration. We will continue to refine the design in pursuit of a fully functional and robust solution.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/dcs-bios/\\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia-m6fQU8SQ",
